# Mapping_Earthquakes

Used JavaScript's Leaflet library along with the Mapbox API to create visualizations of geoJSON earthquake data from the U.S. Geological Survey.

The following pictures are maps of the earthquake data created, featuring multiple layers, data overlays, pop up buttons with information on each individual earthquake, and a legend to help determine earthquake severity.

Light layer featuring all 3 data overlays:

Dark layer featuring major earthquakes and tectonic plate data overlay- as we can see from this picture, most of the major earthquakes tend to all on the plate lines:
